      We are the founders of STEMinism Club!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Isabelle</b> is a sophomore, the unofficial head of recruitment, and the creator of the term "STEMinism". She enjoys all aspects of STEM, especially programming and math. She also loves cats. She finds new ways to "break math" on a regular basis, and is fascinated by the concept of infinity. She has been programming since second grade, and her projects have included way too many video games, a machine learning model that predicts the disciplines of experiments and projects based on their titles, and programs that do her math homework. She also coded this website.
