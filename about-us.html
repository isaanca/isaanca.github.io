    <h2> Leaders </h2>
    <p>
      We are juniors at The Nueva School, and the founders of STEMinism Club!

      <b>Isabelle</b> is the unofficial head of recruitment and creator of the term "STEMinism". She enjoys all aspects of STEM, especially programming and math, and loves cats. She finds new ways to break math on a regular basis, and is fascinated by the concept of infinity. She has been programming since third grade, and her projects have included way too many video games, a machine learning model that predicts the disciplines of experiments and projects based on their titles, curriculum development for summer camps and CS tutoring, and programs that do her math homework. She also coded this website.

      <b>Lauren</b> is the founder and developer of the <a href="https://donationcharityapp.com"> DoNation iOS app and website</a>. She has loved coding since the third grade. DoNation was named winner of the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. She is also co-founder of CS4Girls, an initiative to offer early STEM education to girls through summer camps. In the summer of 2019, CS4Girls will be offering coding camps in Northern California. Lauren also shares her love of coding as assistant coding instructor for Girls Who Code at the San Mateo Public Library. When not programming, you can find Lauren reading on her Kindle or playing volleyball.

      <b>Catherine</b> is the undisputed most responsible member of STEMinism club. She enjoys computer science and musical theater. She is developing a mobile app to educate young STEMinists through the stories of women in STEM. Despite her responsibility, she is yet to submit a bio. Maybe that will change some day.
