      <b>Isabelle</b> is the unofficial head of recruitment, manager of the Google Drive folder, and the creator of the term "STEMinism". She enjoys all aspects of STEM, especially programming and math, and loves cats. She finds new ways to break math on a regular basis, and is fascinated by the concept of infinity. She has been programming since third grade, and her projects have included way too many video games, a machine learning model that predicts the disciplines of Quest projects based on their titles, a continuously integrated Gitlab project coverage display, and programs that do her math homework. She also coded this website.
