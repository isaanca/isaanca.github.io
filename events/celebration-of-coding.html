    <p> On December 7, 2018, students at the Nueva Lower School spent an afternoon learning how to program through various workshops for Computer Science Education Week. We ran an "unplugged" programming workshop with activities similar to our <a href="/events/math-circle.html">Math Circle Workshop</a>: a note-passing internet simulation and a human robot game. </p>
