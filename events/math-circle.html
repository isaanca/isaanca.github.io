      <p> Our first event was at the October 2018 math circle at the Nueva School, an event open to the community. We hosted a programming workshop where students in third through eighth grade spent a fun afternoon learning how the internet worked through a note-passing simulation with index cards, and solved programming puzzles. </p>

      <p> We came back to the Nueva Math Circle for their October 2019 event, where we ran an adaptation of our <a href="/events/escape-room.html">cryptology escape room puzzle</a> for middle schoolers. After a lot of testing from the club, this event was a success! Students cracked several types of codes to follow in the footsteps of cryptanalyst Elizebeth Smith Friedman. </p>
