      <h1> Nueva School Math Circle </h1>
    </div>
    <p> Our first event was at the October 2018 math circle at the Nueva School, an event open to the community. We hosted a programming workshop where students in third through eighth grade spent a fun afternoon taking the role of computers and learning how the internet worked through a note-passing simulation with index cards. Then, in small groups they took turns being robots and programmers, navigating through the forest to collect keys. </p>
