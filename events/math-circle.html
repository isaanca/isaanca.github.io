      <h1> Nueva School Math Circle </h1>
    </div>
    <p> Our first event was at the October 2018 Math Circle event at the Nueva School, an event open to the community. We hosted a programming workshop where students from third through eighth grade spent a fun afternoon  taking the role of computers in the internet. The club developed curriculum that helped students learn about the structure of the internet and the function of IP addresses, as well as problem solving skills. </p>
