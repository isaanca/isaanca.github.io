      <h1> Nueva School Math Circle </h1>
    </div>
    <p> Our first event was at the October 2018 math circle at the Nueva School, an event open to the community. We hosted a programming workshop where students in third through eighth grade spent a fun afternoon learning how the internet worked through a note-passing simulation with index cards, and solved programming puzzles. </p>
