    <h2> What is STEMinism? What are our club's goals? </h2>
    <p> <b>STEMinism is a movement</b>, the empowerment of women and girls in STEM fields. Its goal is to allow women and girls to forge their own path and give them opportunities to pursue their interests, as well as raising awareness of the issue. </p>
    <p> <b>STEMinism is a club.</b> The first ever (as far as we know) STEMinism Club provides a safe space for high schoolers to learn and feel comfortable with failure, support each other, and run events to promote and educate others about STEMinism. And also eat food. The club is also a resource for STEM events and a place to find role models. </p>
    <p> <b>STEMinism starts early.</b> Middle school is a crucial age for young girls, and it is the time when they start to become discouraged from entering STEM fields. STEMinism Club hopes to educate young people through workshops, to foster a love of STEM from an early age. </p>
    <p> <b>STEMinism isn't just for girls.</b> No matter your age, gender identity, or interests, you can be a STEMinist. </p>
    <p> <b>STEMinism is whatever we want it to be!</b> As a new club we are open to ideas and we are constantly looking for ways to make our club better. </p>
